- **Seeds.** Seed your garden with quality content and cultivate your curiosity. Plant seeds in your mind garden by taking smart personal notes ([taking raw notes is useless](https://www.mentalnodes.com/taking-raw-notes-is-useless)). These don't need to be written in a publishable form.

One note in your digital garden = one idea. (what you're currently reading is such a note) [Do not keep orphan notes](https://www.mentalnodes.com/do-not-keep-orphan-notes). [Thread your thoughts.](https://www.mentalnodes.com/threaded-thinking-instead-of-linear-thinking)
- **Fruits.** Produce [new work](https://www.mentalnodes.com/on-the-newness-of-ideas). These are more substantialâ€”essays, videos, maybe a book at some point. The kind of work researchers and creatives may hope will help them [live beyond their expiration date](https://www.mentalnodes.com/living-beyond-your-expiration-date).
