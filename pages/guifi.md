- >Anyone who uses the Guifi.net infrastructure in Catalonia — individual
  internet users, small businesses, government, dozens of small
  internet service providers — is committed to “the development of a
  commons-based, free, open and neutral telecommunications network.”
  This has resulted in Guifi.net providing far better broadband service at
  cheaper prices than, say, Americans receive, who pay very high prices
  to a broadband oligopoly (a median of US$80 month in 2017) for
  slower connectivity and poor customer service. ISPs using Guifi.net
  were charging 18 to 35 euros a month in 2016 (roughly US$20–$37)
  for one gigabit fiber connections, and much lower prices for Wi-Fi.
