- Convivial Tools is a term inspired by [[Ivan Illich]] â€™s Tools for Conviviality
  (1973). It refers to tools, technologies, and infrastructures that
  strengthen creativity and self-determination, such as everyday, general-
  purpose tools, the patterns for Commoning we suggest in this
  book, or open source software-based tools such as OpenStreetMap.42
