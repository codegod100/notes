- The agora is getting rather large so maybe it's time for a databse?
- I've been experimenting with different implementations of building the database at [[garden downloader]]
	- each of them downloads the git files and builds a [[sqlite]] database
- I also have a fork of [[agora server]] that uses the database
	- https://github.com/codegod100/agora-server/blob/db-docker/app/db.py
		- this is very alpha quality, please be kind
