- >The DisCO’s cousins, the DecentralisedAutonomous Organisations, promise to allow people to exchange economic value,to pool resources and form joint-ventures, without control from the centre, in waysthat were impossible before blockchains; to agree on how risks and rewards shouldbe distributed and to enjoy the benefits (or otherwise) of the shared activity in thefuture. However the core concepts of DAOs1 and crypto-economic mechanism design— incentives, penalties and secrecy — are not a natural starting point for most peopleforming new ventures together. Neither, funnily enough, is money.
- >The DisCO Manifesto is a deep dive into the world of Distributed Cooperative Organizations. Over its 80 colorful pages, you will read about how DisCOs are a P2P/Commons, cooperative and Feminist Economic alternative to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (or DAOs). The DisCO Manifesto also includes some background on topics like blockchain, AI, the commons, feminism, cooperatives, cyberpunk, and more.
