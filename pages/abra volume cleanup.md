- there was a ticket for this at one point? i'm not sure where it went... `abra` cannot do this but i think it could probably run a `docker system prune -a -v -f` (with options for the flags) to clean up old stuff? if you wanna search / open a ticket for that, it'd be great! i'd love to have `abra` supporting this
