- Inspired by the principles of [[Zakat]] (read our Founding Member, [[sheeza shah]] ’s article in The Guardian), a morally obligated Islamic practice that dissuades hoarding to redistribute wealth and eradicate poverty, **Zebras Unite Co-op has set aside 2.5% of all gross revenues for a Zebra Solidarity Fund for its co-op members.** This fund will be used to offer financial assistance, advance projects centred on economic justice, underwrite scholarships and experiments serving the [[solidarity economy]] .
