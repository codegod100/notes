- >Commons are highly money efficient, as [[Wolfgang Sachs]] once pointed
  out. They enable us to become less reliant on money, and therefore
  more free from the structural coercion of markets.
- >Moreover, the [[guifi]] experience shows that it is entirely possible
  to build “large-scale, locally owned, broadband infrastructure in more
  locations than telco [telephone company] incumbents,” as open technology
  advocate [[Sascha Meinrath]] put it.16 The mutualizing of costs
  and benefits in a commons regime has a lot to do with this success.
- Everyone is familiar with the “free market” even though
  its variations — stock markets, grocery stores, filmmaking, mining,
  personal services, labor — are at least as eclectic as the commons. But
  culturally, we regard the diversity of markets as normal whereas commons
  are nearly invisible.
- This task becomes easier once we realize that there is no single,
  universal template for assessing a commons. Each bears the distinctive
  marks of its own special origins, culture, people, and context.
- Why do so many discussions about commons rely on
  economic categories of analysis (“types of goods,” “resource allocation,”
  “productivity,” “transaction costs”) when commons are primarily social
  systems for meeting shared needs? This question propelled us on a process
  to reconceptualize in its fullest sense what it means to engage in
  commoning.
