- Monetise the problem
	- For example, the tourism industry in the Caribbean has an economic interest in
	  ecosystem restoration. Corporate employers in Africa have an economic interest in a
	  healthy workforce that’s not suffering from waterborne diseases. And citizens—at
	  the very least—simply want to reside in an economically productive location where
	  basic / universal services in health and education are accessible. These actors thus
	  have an interest to pay for the achievement of the positive outcome, contingent on
	  its success.
- Align diverse stakeholders
	- Using legal innovations such as the [[L3C]] form in the United States, it is possible to
	  create a an equity structure to incentivise different stakeholders both as investors
	  but also the stakeholders who require funding.
- Focus on outcomes over outputs
	- Further, rather than incentivise them to coordinate and cooperate, we let each
	  of them believe that they operate in a zero sum game, in which there can only
	  be one winner. Finally, if and when they reach the other side of the Atlantic,
	  there is no guarantee that they will be landing on fertile ground.
