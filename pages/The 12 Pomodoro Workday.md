The structure is simple:
- 1 pomodoro planning the work day
- 8 pomodoros of work
- 3 pomodoros of breaks
  
  1+8+3 = 12 **pomodoros**,
  
  or 12 pomodoros * 25 minutes = 300 minutes = 5 **hours**
  
  During the planning pomodoro, each of the 11 following pomodoros are laid out in a sheet with specific labels for the tasks.
