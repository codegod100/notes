- I have two parsers I've started working on, both of them are using [[PEG grammar]]
- [[python]]
	- https://git.anagora.org/vera/myco
		- using [[canopy]]
			- http://canopy.jcoglan.com/langs/python.html
- [[rust]]
	- https://git.anagora.org/vera/mycorust
		- I ended up converting to a native python extension with [[py03]]
		- using [[pest]] https://docs.rs/pest/latest/pest/
		- very alpha
		- formal grammar
			- https://git.anagora.org/vera/mycorust/src/branch/yolo/src/block.pest
	- I'm planning on turning this into a [[wasm]] module and maybe use with [https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-python](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-python) in [[agora server]]
