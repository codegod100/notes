- I have two parsers I've started working on, both of them are using [[PEG grammar]]
- [[python]]
	- https://git.anagora.org/vera/myco
		- using [[canopy]]
			- http://canopy.jcoglan.com/langs/python.html
- [[rust]]
	- https://git.anagora.org/vera/mycorust
		- I ended up converting to a native python extension with [[py03]]
		- using [[pest]]
		- very alpha
		- formal grammar
			- https://git.anagora.org/vera/mycorust/src/branch/yolo/src/block.pest
	- maybe use [[wasmer python]]
