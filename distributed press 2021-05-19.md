[[ipfs gateways]]
- [[Paul Frazee]]
	- say you're [[twitter]], 1000 users. 
	- 1000 users only one using service but having to pay for storage/bandwidth of 1000 poor scaling properties
	- gateway not feasible model
	- what are the costs
	- magic of the mesh
	- serverless clients participate in network
- [[guo]]
	-  gateways become the point of failure in a distributed network
-  [[flancian]]
	-  subsidies gateway not for profit

[[beaker]]
- social network on beaker
- got discouraged with social networks
	- came back
- people wanna be able to share around links
- didn't have push messaging system
- take advantage of social graph
- ux killer
	- people expect to get notifcations from people
	- people need to follow out of band
	- limited push message
	- aggregator service notifications
		- really close to running gateway, running a service
		- let's just use services
		- take your data and move to other "place"


[[minimum viable exchange format]]
- all these technologies converge into this
- [[indieweb]]
- [[microformats]]
- [[minimal social graph]]
	- [[guo]]
		- can be [[ipfs]] can be [[dat]]
		- have to have an aggregator, how do you know if there's new content
		- how do you do search
		- separate data aggregator and host
	- [[flancian]]
		- [[underlay project]]
	- [[Paul Frazee]]
		- [[data mesh]]
			- basically function like database 
				- way for semantic 
				- tables in there with universal ide (url based to find schema)
				- universal global data mesh, with global semantics
				- [[governance of the commons]]

	- [[guo]]
		- if we can determine ownership we can help with governance issue
		- if it's my data, there is no governance issue


[[commons mesh]]
- how do you end up in a situation where governance is required
- what are defaults
- sign up for first time, what's being suggested
