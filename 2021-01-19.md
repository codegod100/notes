editing notes when day changes is interesting because [[obsidian]] automatically goes to note for that day with the daily note button

I've been trying out new desktop environments. [[xfce]] is kinda slow not sure if it's just aging or if it's because it needs to load [[kde]] for the [[kwin]] window manager. 

[[enlightenment desktop]]
-	fast but hideous UI
-	I think it messed with my network settings because it uses [[connman]]


I'm trying out [[lxqt]] which is fast but kinda ugly. I wish designers were more into lightweight [[desktop environment]]s

experimenting with different types of [[note refactoring]]

TIL [[flancian]] is in [[CET]] which is the same timezone as Paris and Rome

[[svelte]]

One of the things I like about tending my [[digital-garden]] is that there is no pressure on display or content, if I was feeling like writing a blog article I have to form complete sentences and such, but note taking, by design, is very free form.
