going to [[in and out]] burger place today. I move on monday

lots of change. my laptop is dying.. I love buying cheap ones. Expensive electronics rub me the wrong way

[[swapspace]] is a nice linux package. it creates a virtual [[swap]] partition for servers with no dedicated swap and manages it for you. All you have to do is install the package, it's [[zero configuration]]

[[htop]] is such a nice app for managing system resources, it's how I discovered my swap issue
