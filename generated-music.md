there is a certain quality to generated music that I find fascinating. People seem to resonate a certain way to music. Everyone has their favorite kind but it seems like people tend to like at least *some* kind of music. Why do we possess this inherent attraction to music? Is there some sort of deeper pattern there? Is there an ideal sound that resonates with the human mind? Can you control people through music?
