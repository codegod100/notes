I really like the formatting changes [[flancian]] has done

experimenting with working directly out of public repo rather than scrubbing private notes each time. oI don't really even use private notes since I started [[tending the garden]] more.

Making a link to [[republic services]] while I'm thinking about it

Glad to have [[obsidian]] to manage notes

I keep accidentally closing a tab instead of clicking on it. Seems like a design [[anti-pattern]] 

I've been [[refactoring notes]] by looking for long bulleted lists and moving the list into a proper top level note

Can't believe that I didn't create node for [[digital-garden]] until today

Reading about [[the expanding circle]]

More internal reflection on the [[emotional narrative]]

Debating adding [[interesting sites]]

[Roam's Original Whitepaper](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) made clear the original vision for the tool is toward collaborative networked research.

Journaling in [[GitJournal]] kinda sucks. I need to figure out a better flow so I actually take notes. Maybe I just have a rough version at first and then tend with [[obsidian]]?
