- Creating this note to brainstorm what we actually want out of the [[agora]]
- interlay
	- read only
		- do we want our own user data?
		- if we decide to do write, what does that look like
	- a [[universal bus]]/cpu
	- what are our goals based on this

- unified identifier
	- we need a canonical way to address people in the [[agora]]
		- user@host
		- [[did]]
		- [[solid]] [[webid]]
		- 
- [[data commons]]
	- I feel like the agora is an app on the [[data commons]]
	- [[understory]] describes themselves as such

- [[gardener coalition]]
