>   - COSMOS Hub validators participate in consensus by broadcasting cryptographic signatures, or votes, to commit blocks. [[tendermint]] requires a fixed known set of validators, where each validator is identified by their public key. Validators attempt to come to consensus one block at a time, where a block is a list of transactions.
