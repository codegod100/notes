>Ecko is a community-driven fork of Mastodon's social network software. The idea for the fork is to optimize toward community, that is making it as easy as possible to contribute. We're following a protocol called the Collective Code Construction Contract (C4) that says if you are addressing a valid problem, your code gets merged. Everything else follows from that.
