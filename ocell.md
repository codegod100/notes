		- I [[love]] them.
 	- [[twitter]] https://flancia.org/t/ocell
	- She lives with us: 
		- [[flancian]] https://twitter.com/flancian/status/1325024046346539008
		- Previously in a shelter in [[granada]]. We adopted her when she was a bit over a year old.
		- We picked her up in Brugg on [[2020-11-07]].
		- Technically her name is masculine (it means "bird" in Catalan) but I don't think she cares about grammatical gender.
		- [[pull]] [[lady burup]] is her pseudonymous.
