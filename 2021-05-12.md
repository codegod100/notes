[[atomic note taking]] is getting more and more intuitive

I'm working on a [[fork]] that adds [[ctzn]] login functionality to the [[agora]]. My hope is that we can leverage that tech to make a mobile-friendly read/write interface to the [[agora]]

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[fork]: fork.md "fork"
[ctzn]: ctzn.md "ctzn"
[agora]: agora.md "agora"
[agora]: agora.md "agora"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
