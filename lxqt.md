-	besides not being the prettiest, it is very fast and responsive
-	startup time is amazing
-	I've configured it so that it looks presentable
-	so "single click to activate items" just means enable tap, ugh I hate developers sometimes
-	uses [[lxqt-runner]] to run one-off commands, I actually quite like it
-	seems to work well with [[kwin]] [[window manager]] from [[kde]]
	-	both of them use [[Qt]] under the hood, which I kinda prefer over [[gtk]]
