- Been messing with [[abra]] a lot lately
- Made a recipe to deploy the agora [codegod100/agora-abra: abra recipe for agora (github.com)](https://github.com/codegod100/agora-abra)
- you can add env variable to your server config to enable custom sources.yml
	- located in ~/.abra/servers/<your server>/<your host>.env
	- e.g. SOURCES_YML_URL=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/codegod100/334c277d2f905f41576bc96758062a6e/raw/bac818c2418e94739ed8cf9d8a0080d1d9ddbce4/vera.yml
- this config creates a single user agora that I use at https://agora.cloud.vera.pink
