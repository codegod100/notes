- I am starting with a disclaimer that while this concept uses science and math it is categorically metaphysical and should be used for educational purposes only
- We model the universe as a bit matrix of
	- the size of the matrix is equal to maxium entropy of the system, for our example we use a value of 4, but you could just as easily plugin the maximum entropy of the actual univserse (1e122 according to Max Tegmark)
- initial universe configuration "empty universe" (pre big bang)
	- ![[Pasted image 20210604121534.png]]
	- this represents a universe with a max entropy of 4 (4 bit slots)
- universes move from one matrix stage to the next, each stage can exist in a set of superpositions, a superposition is represented by the total amount of possible combinations in that stage e.g.
	- stage one 
		- one bit is added to our matrix
			- ![[Pasted image 20210604122001.png]]
			- we see in this stage there are four possible superpositions
			- we can traverse from stage zero to any superposition in stage one
			- in the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics there is a link between stage zero and all superpositions of stage one
			- Counting the number of superpositions is intuitive all small values but can be computed for large values using the combination formula
				- ![[Pasted image 20210604122655.png]]
				- n here is the total entropy of our system, r is the stage number
				- for stage one 4C1 = 4!/(1!3!) = 4
	- stage two
		- in stage two we are working with two bits of data, using the combination formula we see that the total number of superpositions in stage two is 6
