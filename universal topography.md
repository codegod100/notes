- I am starting with a disclaimer that while this concept uses science and math it is categorically metaphysical and should be used for educational purposes only
- We model the universe as a bit matrix of
	- the size of the matrix is equal to maxium entropy of the system, for our example we use a value of 4, but you could just as easily plugin the maximum entropy of the actual univserse (1e122 according to Max Tegmark)
- initial universe configuration "empty universe" (pre big bang)
	- ![[Pasted image 20210604121534.png]]
	- this represents a universe with a max entropy of 4 (4 bit slots)
- universes move from one matrix stage to the next, each stage can exist in a set of superpositions, a superposition is represented by the total amount of possible combinations in that stage e.g.
	- stage one
