Here's an outline for possible [[twitter]]/[[mastodon]] integration

[[twitter]] user e.g. vera@twitter.com posts something like 


#push [[test]]
-	testing


this would create a note in [[test]] with the text "testing" from user vera@twitter.com

Remaining problems:
-	how do we store data?
-	if we push data to the [[agora]] more than once for same user for same wikilink does it override the note?
