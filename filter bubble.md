- A filter bubble is a term coined by the Internet activist [[Eli Pariser]] to refer to a state of [[intellectual isolation]] that can result from [[personalized searches]] when a website algorithm selectively guesses what information a user would like to see based on information about the user, such as location, past [[click-behavior]] and [[search history]].
