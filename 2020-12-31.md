  found [[librephotos]] google photo alternative
  
  found [[cmd.fm]] which plays radio from a web based [[cli]], it's novel but not super useful
  
  also playing with [[nano.page]] looks like some shared knowledge graph or something. Doesn't look like it brings anything new to the table except maybe that the social aspect could be interesting
