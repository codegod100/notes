- While [[tending my garden]], I discovered that certain nodes have common "shapes"
- [[agora]] node has many incoming links, whereas [[journal nodes]] tend to have many outgoing links

- node category types
	- incoming
	- outgoing

- I'll add more types here as I find them

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[agora]: agora.md "agora"
[journal nodes]: journal nodes.md "journal nodes"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
