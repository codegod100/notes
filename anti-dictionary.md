* idea I've been mulling over lately. Take for example the concept of a dictionary: each entry has a canonical defintion of what people think that word means. wikipedia works the same way. but an anti-dictionary is a tool that allows the inverse of this, you select an identifier and then it gives you a list of what different people think this means. I consider [[agora]] to be an anti-dictionary. I wonder what [[flancian]] thinks of this.
* [[urban dictionary]] is a good example of an anti-dictionary
