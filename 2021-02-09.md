Journaling again. I'm gonna have to force myself to do this. I just need to remind myself it isn't that hard and I need to make it more personal so I'm more invested.

I really like [[obsidian]], I can't wait until they release a mobile client

Just discovered [[cabal.chat]] it reminds me of [[tox]] and [[session]]. Personally I prefer [[matrix]]

I'm really stoked that I found [[pinafore]] because it turned me onto [[svelte]] which has re-invigorated my interest in [[front end development]]
