- Working today on [[integration of the agora]] with external sources starting with [[twitter]] and [[fediverse]]
  
  I'm thinking of having anyone with a [[twitter]]/[[masto]] account "claim" their id on [[agora]] which is just going to be their id on the external site e.g. vera@twitter.com

  [[agora as documentation]]
  
  Started development on [[moa party]] for [[agora server]] integration. I'm going to take data from [[mastodon]]/[[twitter]] and shovel it over to a git repo via a git web interface probably using gitlab at first since that's our stoa org.
