Working today on [[integration of the agora]] with external sources starting with [[twitter]] and [[fediverse]]

I'm thinking of having anyone with a [[twitter]]/[[masto]] account "claim" their id on [[agora]] which is just going to be their id on the external site e.g. vera@twitter.com

>“We should be able to say, “This is my truth,” and have that truth stand without a hundred clamoring voices shouting, giving the impression that multiple truths cannot coexist.” ―  Roxane Gay,   [Bad Feminist: Essays](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/26563816)

>“Feminists are just women who don’t want to be treated like shit”

[[agora as documentation]]

Started development on [[moa party]] for [[agora server]] integration. I'm going to take data from [[mastodon]]/[[twitter]] and shovel it over to a git repo via a git web interface probably using gitlab at first since that's our stoa org.
