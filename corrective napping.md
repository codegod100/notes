I suffer from [[insomnia]] and I've been trying to come up with solution to help with this. One method has been using [[psilocybin mushrooms]] another tactic has been trying to math out how many hours I should sleep in a day and then using that to create an algorithm to determine a corrective sleep schedule. So far, I've yet to determine such algorithm, but I am hopeful such a thing is knowable.
