theory that states probabilities are an emergent phenonenom of us being uncertain of what timeline we're in.

Confusing stuff but interesting none the less


>In this article we argue that probability arises in Everettian quantum mechanics because observers with perfect knowledge (of their immediate circumstances and the state of the universe as a whole) necessarily evolve into conditions of self-locating uncertainty, in which they do not know which approximately isolated semi-classical world (or ‘branch’) they inhabit



>In Everettian quantum mechanics, the wave function branches when the system becomes sufficiently entangled with the environment to produce decoherence
