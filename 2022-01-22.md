I missed [[flancia meet]] this morning. I was too tired and was sleeping lol. At least I had some good sleep. I suffer from pretty bad [[insomnia]] and I'll go days without sleeping. It looks like [[esperanto]] came up which is an interesting throwback. I used to study esperanto back in the day with friends and I'm somewhat fluent.

The problem with altruistic giving and expecting a quantified result is you're assuming the person you're giving to is there because of a problem involving them.
