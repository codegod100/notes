Among the many initiatives that are being created at the moment, I want to mention [sole-freiburg.de](http://sole-freiburg.de) (life and solidarity). Their basic axiom sounds so simple, that it almost hurts: “We help each other, we contribute things or services according to everybody’s possibilities for the benefit of others. We do not keep book on what is given or received.” Imagine how horrible this must sound in the ears of market fetishists.
