trying out [[agora clients]] again. I've been messing with [[joplin]] I've used it before, let's see how it goes.

I went to the doctors to get [[sti testing]] my results came back negative for everything. #testingissexy

I'm downloading a bunch of note apps to see what works on mobile. I signed up for [[notion]] [[api]] so we'll see what happens with that
