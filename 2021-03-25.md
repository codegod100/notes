Finally making a new note! Been playing with [[kde]] also known as [[plasma desktop]] nowadays. I've been using [[linux]] for over 20 years and never really gave it a proper chance, but with the right tweaks, I have faith it will work well

I got [[roller skates]] the other day. I'm stoked, they're white and have light up wheels

I'm sad that [[obsidian]] mobile has decided to go for a for-pay model for their beta [[android]] client. Oh well. I might end up buying a subscription, we'll see
