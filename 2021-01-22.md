played around a lot with [[the federation]], thats what I'm calling the [[fediverse]] now since I like the name a lot better

Talked to [[flancian]] about [[note blocks]] and semantic structuring

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[the federation]: the federation.md "the federation"
[fediverse]: fediverse.md "fediverse"
[flancian]: flancian.md "flancian"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
