Divide social activity in digital spaces into two categories: _discussion_ and _reference_.

Most activity is _discussion_: news or blog updates, shared links, forum discussions, microblogging hot takes, comments, private or group messages, livestreaming, newsletters. They speak to a particular moment in time.

Examples of _reference_ can include: wikis, git repositories, project documentation, question/answer sites or FAQs, indexes. These resources are not directly concerned with specific moments in time — they attempt to be organized according to context and relevance.

_Discussion_ begins to fade the moment it is published. It can be temporarily revived (bumped) by some kind of activity or update, but this itself is a form of _discussion_ that begins to fade on arrival.
