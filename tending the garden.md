Feels like maintaining a bonzai tree

I feel like mainitaining the garden helps to motivate me to interact with it, especially if I am having difficulty wanting to add new information.
-	Maybe I don't want to add new information because I feel like if the garden isn't in a tidy state then I am just adding to the disorder

Don't be afraid to edit existing notes/nodes, this is an [[ever expanding project]]
