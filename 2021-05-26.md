- realized my oculus runs on [[display port]] not [[hdmi]]. the connectors look similar, I thought it was [[mini hdmi]] on my laptop because connector was so big lol, ok another visit to amazon to get the right thing
	- I ended up getting a display port to [[usb c]] adapter, we'll see if that works out
