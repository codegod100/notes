Got a new [[asus]] [[zenbook]] My display drivers were wonky when I was running [[kubuntu]] so I installed [[manjaro]] it seems to be working better now

I made a [[zulip]] instance for discussing [[agora]] stuff

I'm mulling over ideas on how to extend [[rational disscusion and decision making]] since that is a stated goal of the [[agora]] on the flancia website
