# [Zero Data App](https://0data.app/)

-   an app in which _your data stays with you_
-   _you control where_ the data is stored
-   no spam, no captcha, no sign up, no passwords, _bring your own identity_
-   using open protocols for _flexibility and interoperability_
-   _do what you want_ with your data at _any time_
-   your data is _accessible forever_ even if the app stops working


This seems to be running the same engine as [[remoteStorage]]/[[hyperdraft]]/et al
