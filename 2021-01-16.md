[[prolertarian culture]]

Who controls the [[fediverse]]?

the [[agora]] promotes [[passive learning]]

I learned that I can read [[research papers]] through [[jstor]] with my [[library card]]
-	Also learned that theres a list of external resources I can use on the library website
-	There is also [[kanopy]] which is a [[netflix]] type of [[streaming video service]] that allows you to watch content by logging in with library card

[[openathens]]

There is a ton of [[gatekeeping]] for research papers. I blame [[capitalism]]

[[core]] The worldâ€™s largest collection of open access research papers
-	https://core.ac.uk/

might start using [[pocket]] for research notes. [[firefox]] has a built-in "save to pocket" feature that might be handy for multi-device stuff
-	doesn't work because links are behind paywall, I thought it would download the whole file rather than just have a link. Oh well

[[peertube]]

[[taizen]]

[[the weed tube]]

[[calibre]] linux ebook reader
-	[[epub]] is my favorite ebook format

I've been uploading my ebooks to [[private matrix channel]]  for later retrieval
-	I don't trust [[cloud storage]] like [[dropbox]], I like to keep personal redundant copies of my data/media


Discovered that [[internet archive]] is a good resource for searching for ebooks

-	pdf to ebook conversion is a bit wonky, which is understable since it's simply [[OCR]] technology
