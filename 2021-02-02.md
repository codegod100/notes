I'm journaling thanks to [[flancian]] encouraging me.

Life lately has been hectic. I'm trying to motivate myself to get back into [[python]] so I can work on [[agora]] code

I'm trying to quit smoking. That has been rough. Nicotene cravings are so overwhelming. One of the downsides to not journaling is that I don't discover new things that that puts a damper on my [[mental acuity]]

I've been trying to find [[muggle work]] but it's been a chore. I've been looking at [[light industrial work]] since that is usually pretty mindless. I live mindless labor. I feel like I can just dissociate and let the day go by lol
