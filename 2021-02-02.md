I'm journaling thanks to [[flancian]] encouraging me.

Life lately has been hectic. I'm trying to motivate myself to get back into [[python]] so I can work on [[agora]] code

I'm trying to quit smoking. That has been rough. Nicotene cravings are so overwhelming. One of the downsides to not journaling is that I don't discover new things that that puts a damper on my [[mental acuity]]

I've been trying to find [[muggle work]] but it's been a chore. I've been looking at [[light industrial work]] since that is usually pretty mindless. I live mindless labor. I feel like I can just dissociate and let the day go by lol

China, the worldâ€™s biggest car market, [recently ordered](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/business/gm-china-electric-cars.html) that most new cars be powered by electricity in just 15 years.
