- My objective is to build a governance system into the [[agora]]
- proposals will be submitted as nodes
- people respond to proposals by creating a node with the same name as the proposal, any #tags will be counted as a vote
	- so e.g. you enter #yes into your node and someone else enters #yes as well there will be two votes for #yes, votes can be any tag name
- I want to add a `/proposal` route to the [[agora]] to have a special proposal view for governance
