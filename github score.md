# github score


My personal scoring I use for github repos consists of

-	frequency
	-	how often do they update their repo (commit frequency)
-	interest
	-	how many github stars does it have
-	diversity
	-	how many contributors does it have

I'm working on an algorithm that will produce a normalized score in which to rank github repos.
