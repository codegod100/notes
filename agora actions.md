- in the [[agora]] we actions that trigger certain internal actions
- list of common actions
	- #go
	- #pulll
	- #push
- I'm tempted to create a different action format because:
	- action links (most notably #go links) mess with my graph view in obsidian
	- they aren't [[wikilinks]] they are categorcially different things
	- pitfalls of changing
		- requires restructuring current code
		- people are already using the current fomat
- proposed alternatives
	- action:{{action name}}
	- tag format e.g. #go #push 
		- I'm actually starting to like this version better

- issues
	- an agora can only support a finite list of actions so we need to configure them somewhere
	- #todo 
		- [ ] create config.yaml
		- [ ] add actions to config yaml
