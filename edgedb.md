EdgeDB is a next-generation graph-relational database designed as a spiritual successor to the relational database.

When installing edge the easiest way to use certs is EDGEDB_SERVER_TLS_KEY_FILE & EDGEDB_SERVER_TLS_CERT_FILE this gave me a huge headache trying to figure this out when deploying to a server. You can generate the certificates with [[certbot]].
