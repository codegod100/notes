* checking out [[logseq]] reminds me of [[nano.page]]
	* Oddly doesn't work on [[firefox]], downloading [[vivaldi]]
	* looks kinda boring. default dailt file is in funky format.
	* it looks pretty though
* started putting bullets in my notes to easier segment sections. 
	* Finding it easier to refactor content of notes
* Found [[mentalnodes]]
* [[underscore protocol]]
	* website talks about [[DAO]] I'm kinda sus of it
* met [[maya kate]] and talked about [[folkpunk]] and [[agora]] and simpler web interfaces in general

* [[anti-dictionary]]
* [[emotional narrative]]
* [x] [[todo]] watch [[philomena cunk]] shakespeare
* stumbled on [[coolguy.website]] I forget how I landed on the page but the url is interesting if nothing else
	* they version their website using the [[tarot versioning system]] which seems to just use the number displayed from the major arcana. kinda interesting https://coolguy.website/versionIII/
	* [sentimental versioning manifesto](http://sentimentalversioning.org)
* Thought about the effects of having a daily shared ritual like [[roam-like]] daily logs
	* everyone is doing the same thing every day and ostensibly checking what other people are doing. I feel like this has a very interesting effect on our shared psyche
* Interesting thoughts on [[need]], do we define what we need or do other people?
* I've been thinking about the concept of [[performance anxiety]] when it comes to shared notes. 
* Getting the itch to build browser extension for [[agora]] that web-links wikilinks back to the [[agora]]
