Woke up early today. I have an interview with a new [[communal house]] today

messed around with [[elasticsearch]] to try and get notes into a database, it decided to eat all my available ram and freeze my computer. yay.

I really like the free form flow of the [[daily note]] since the topic is literally just what day I'm on, everything is relevant, by definition
